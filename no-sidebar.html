								<h2><a href="#">Our Vision</a></h2>
								<p>
                                    Located in San Francisco, California, Imnother's mission was created by five passionate teens with the 
                                desire to empower girls to be exactly who they are. The design team was being introduced to HTML when the idea 
                                formed. Attending an all female summer program, these girls knew how important it was to be aware of the different 
                                educational opportunities. With that being said, by providing knowledge, and tools the team hopes to give females around
                                the world the opportunities that they desire, to reach beyond what they give themselves credit for.
                                After all, sometimes girls need a little push to remember they are not "her".
